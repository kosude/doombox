This repository contains all documentation and code for DOOMbox.
    (Note that 'DOOMbox' isn't necessarily a final name yet)

My final goal for this project is an encased physical console dedicated to
running a purpose-built DOOM clone, with a bunch of extra features just to push
the hardware being used to its limits.

The aim is not to be historically authentic to DOOM. If it was then I would be
porting something like Chocolate Doom instead, which Graham Saunderson has
already done:

That said, I will be using similar hardware to that project. The DOOMbox
software will be designed to run on RP2xxx devices.
